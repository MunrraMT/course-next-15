# Next.js 15 &amp; React - The Complete Guide

_Update October 2024:_

Updated content to reflect latest version of Next.js (15).

_Update March/April 2024:_

Completely updated the entire course to cover the latest version of Next.js!

This course teaches you the _latest version of Next.js_ and covers both the _"App Router" and "Pages Router"_ (and explains what these two approaches are).

_Join this bestselling NextJS course and learn how to build highly dynamic, super fast and SEO-ready React apps with React & NextJS!_

This course covers both the NextJS "App Router" & the "Pages Router" - two different approaches for building fullstack apps with React! And, of course, you'll learn what these two approaches are, why two different approaches exist and how each approach works!

I created the _bestselling Udemy course on React_, now I'm super excited to share this NextJS with you - an _in-depth course_ about an amazing React framework that allows you to _take the next step as a React developer_ and build real, production-ready projects with React and Next.js!

_Next.js_ is the _production-ready, fullstack-capable_ framework for _ReactJS_ - the _most popular JavaScript library_ you can learn these days!

Too many buzzwords for your taste?

Fair enough - but indeed, NextJS is a great choice for _growing as a React developer_ and for _taking your React apps to the next level!_

Because _NextJS is growing fast and therefore in high demand_. And there are good reasons for that: NextJS allows you to build React apps with _built-in server-side rendering_ and _page pre-rendering_. Building great user experiences and search engine friendly (SEO!) React apps has never been easier!

In addition, NextJS makes building _fullstack React apps_ (frontend + backend code combined in one project) extremely easy as well! Blend client-side and server-side code and build a NodeJS-based API side-by-side with your frontend React apps. It's a breeze with NextJS!

Want to add authentication? NextJS simplifies that as well and makes user signup, sign in and session management very convenient.

_This course will take you from NextJS beginner to advanced level in no time!_

We'll start at the very basics, no NextJS knowledge is required at all, and we'll then dive into all the core features that make up NextJS. Both in theory as well as with _multiple real projects_ where all concepts will be applied step-by-step.

For this course, you'll need _basic React knowledge_, though the course does come with a _"React refresher"_ module in case it's been some time since you last worked with React.

This course also includes a _"NextJS Summary" module_ for the Pages router and a _"NextJS Essentials"_ module for the App router - which allow you to always come back to the course in the future and refresh your knowledge without going through the full course again. Or you just take those summary modules (and skip the rest for now) to learn about all the core features in as little time as possible.

After finishing this course, you'll be well prepared to build your own NextJS projects from the ground up and apply for NextJS positions!

_In detail, this course will cover:_

- What is NextJS? And why would you use it?

- Why is just React (in many cases) not enough?

- Creating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects

- Working with file-based routing

- Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes

- Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering

- A complete React.js refresher module (so that we're all on the same page)

- A NextJS summary module so that you can refresh what you learned or just explore the core features quickly

- And much more!

_I can't wait to start this journey together with you! :)_
